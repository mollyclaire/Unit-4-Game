# Unit-4-Game - Crystals Collector

## Motivation
I created this project as homework assignment #4 for UT Coding Bootcamp.

## Tech/Framework Used
- Bootstrap
- jQuery

## How To Use
You will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
There are four crystals on the page. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score (see box called "Your Number").
You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
Each time the game starts, the value of the crystal changes.
